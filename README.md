# Analysis on Lyft's Bay Wheels Bike Sharing Business
In this investigation, we focused on Lyftâ€™s bike sharing business by analyzing the usage frequency, distance and duration. We also examined how factors such as the time of usage, user type and Bike Share for All* enrollment could affect the aforementioned variable.

This dataset originally consisted of more than 4.7 million bike trips and spanned over a 2-year time frame. Main attributes included distance, duration, time of usage (day of week, time period, hour), user type (subscriber/customer) and Bike Share for All enrollments. 500,000 data points were removed from this analysis due to missing or inaccurate information.
